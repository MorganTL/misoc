 the original high performance and small footprint SoC based on Migen

[> Features
-----------
 * Multiple CPU options:
   * VexRiscV.
   * mor1kx (a better OpenRISC implementation).
   * LatticeMico32, modified to include an optional MMU (experimental).  
 * Supports SDR, DDR, LPDDR, DDR2 and DDR3.
 * Provided peripherals: UART, GPIO, timer, NOR flash controller, SPI flash
   controller, Ethernet MAC, and more.
 * High performance: on Kintex-7, 125MHz system clock frequencies,
   64Gbps DDR3 SDRAM bandwidth.
 * Low resource usage: basic implementation fits easily in Spartan-6 LX9.
 * Portable and easy to customize thanks to Python- and Migen-based
   architecture.
 * Design new peripherals using Migen and benefit from automatic CSR maps
   and logic, etc.
 * Possibility to encapsulate legacy Verilog/VHDL code.

MiSoC comes with built-in targets for a few boards. Support for other boards can 
easily be added as external modules.
